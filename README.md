### Obesity Classification 


### About Dataset
The data include the estimation of obesity levels in people from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia. They are aged between 14 and 61, with diverse eating habits and physical condition. Data collected obtained 17 attributes and 2111 records.

#### The attributes related with eating habits are: 
* Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC) 
* Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC)
* Number of main meals (NCP)
* Consumption of food between meals (CAEC),
* Consumption of water daily (CH20),
* and Consumption of alcohol (CALC).
#### The attributes related with the physical condition are:
* Calories consumption monitoring (SCC),
* Physical activity frequency (FAF),
* Time using technology devices (TUE),
* Transportation used (MTRANS)

Variables obtained :
Gender, Age, Height and Weight.

The records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III. 


The data contains numerical data and continous data, so it can be used for analysis based on algorithms of classification, prediction, segmentation and association. Data is available in CSV format.

### Scope and limitations
The World Health Organisation (WHO) Some studies have indicated that individuals of Asian descent may have a higher body fat percentage at a lower BMI compared to other ethnic groups. As a result, some researchers and health organizations have proposed using lower BMI thresholds to define overweight and obesity for Asian populations.

For example, the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF), which is affiliated with the WHO, has proposed BMI thresholds specific to Asian populations. According to the IOTF criteria, the BMI thresholds for overweight and obesity for Asian adults are:

Overweight: BMI ≥ 23 kg/m²
Obesity: BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m²
These thresholds are lower than the standard WHO thresholds, which are:

Overweight: BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²
It's important to note that these BMI thresholds are recommendations and guidelines, and individual health assessments should consider additional factors such as waist circumference, body composition, and overall health status.

Ultimately, while the WHO uses universal BMI thresholds for defining overweight and obesity, healthcare providers and policymakers may consider using population-specific thresholds for certain ethnic groups, including Asians, based on available evidence and guidelines from organizations like the IOTF.
